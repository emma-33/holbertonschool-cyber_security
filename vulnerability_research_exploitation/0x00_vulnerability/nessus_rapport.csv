117886,,,Info,192.168.56.101,tcp,0,OS Security Patch Assessment Not Available,OS Security Patch Assessment is not available.,"OS Security Patch Assessment is not available on the remote host. This does not necessarily indicate a problem with the scan. Credentials may not have been provided, OS security patch assessment may not be supported for the target, the target may not have been identified, or another issue may have occurred that prevented OS security patch assessment from being available. See plugin output for details.  This plugin reports non-failure information impacting the availability of OS Security Patch Assessment. Failure information is reported by plugin 21745 : 'OS Security Patch Assessment failed'.  If a target host is not supported for OS Security Patch Assessment, plugin 110695 : 'OS Security Patch Assessment Checks Not Supported' will report concurrently with this plugin."
19506,,,Info,192.168.56.101,tcp,0,Nessus Scan Information,This plugin displays information about the Nessus scan.,"This plugin displays, for each tested host, information about the scan itself :    - The version of the plugin set.   - The type of scanner (Nessus or Nessus Home).   - The version of the Nessus Engine.   - The port scanner(s) used.   - The port range scanned.   - The ping round trip time    - Whether credentialed or third-party patch management     checks are possible.   - Whether the display of superseded patches is enabled   - The date of the scan.   - The duration of the scan.   - The number of hosts scanned in parallel.   - The number of checks done in parallel."
45590,,,Info,192.168.56.101,tcp,0,Common Platform Enumeration (CPE),It was possible to enumerate CPE names that matched on the remote system.,"By using information obtained from a Nessus scan, this plugin reports CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) matches for various hardware and software products found on a host.   Note that if an official CPE is not available for the product, this plugin computes the best possible CPE based on the information available from the scan."
110723,,,Info,192.168.56.101,tcp,0,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - No Credentials Provided,"Nessus was able to find common ports used for local checks, however, no credentials were provided in the scan policy.","Nessus was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.  Please note the following :  - This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.  - Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets."

24786,,,Info,192.168.56.101,tcp,0,Nessus Windows Scan Not Performed with Admin Privileges,The Nessus scan of this host may be incomplete due to insufficient privileges provided.,"The Nessus scanner testing the remote host has been given SMB credentials to log into the remote host, however these credentials do not have administrative privileges.   Typically, when Nessus performs a patch audit, it logs into the remote host and reads the version of the DLLs on the remote host to determine if a given patch has been applied or not.  This is the method Microsoft recommends to determine if a patch has been applied.   If your Nessus scanner does not have administrative privileges when doing a scan, then Nessus has to fall back to perform a patch audit through the registry which may lead to false positives (especially when using third-party patch auditing tools) or to false negatives (not all patches can be detected through the registry)."
135860,,,Info,192.168.56.101,tcp,445,WMI Not Available,WMI queries could not be made against the remote host.,"WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is not available on the remote host over DCOM.
